          <span id='p1'>
          A long time ago... In a state far, far, away... A boy was born in Columbia, MO.
          Let's call him Zach. Lame, right? Well, strap in, cause we're just getting started.
          </span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span id='p2'>
          Zach then moved to Virginia when he was two. He lived there till he was five, and after 
          completing kindergarten, moved back to Missouri. He completed grades first through sixth there.
          Truly a remarkable acomplishment. Then he moved back to Virginia for seventh grade and part of 
          eigth grade. Then he moved back to Missouri for eighth, ninth, and tenth grade. ALL OF A SUDDEN, he 
          moved to North Carolina where he completed high school.
          </span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span id='p3'>
          By now, you're probably thinking this main 
          character is lame. You're right! All he's done in this story is move places and go to public school.
          Well, don't worry reader, the story only gets slightly better. Actually, not really. After high school, he moved to Fresno 
          California to begin attending Fresno City College. After a year of not knowing what the heck he wanted 
          to do with his life, he decided to take a programming course.
          </span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span id='p4'>
          That was when he found the career path 
          that most suited him. Coding. This led him to take more programming classes where one of his teachers 
          took the class for a tour of bitwise. Soon after, he enrolled into the intro js class because his programming 
          concepts were fairly developed, but he didnt know how alike c++ and javascript would be. Thankfully, they were 
          SUPER similar, and not only that, but he didnt have to declare what types of variables he was using. It was amazing. 
          Then he took no-instructor js afterwards, and built a really cool website over six weeks.
          </span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span id='p5'>
          However, Zach wasn't very good at website design, so he did more of the javascript. He planned on taking angular, 
          but when not enough people registered, he seized the opportunity to take the mobile-friendly class, so that his 
          website building skills weren't mediocre.
